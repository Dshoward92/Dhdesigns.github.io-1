	<p>The goal of Dylan Howard Designs is meant to make you think as well as relate.<br> 
	Though there are many designs that are done for fun and for show, overall we want<br> you 
	to look at a design and not only be intrigued, but make a personal connection with it.<br>
	As you look at our designs and feel inspired or want to make your own personal design,<br>
	reach our to us and we will take care of you!  </p>
